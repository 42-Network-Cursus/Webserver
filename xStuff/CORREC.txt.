Setup a default file to search for if you ask for a directory.
=> CHAT GPT
When index directory listing is not turned on in Nginx, and you attempt to access a directory on a website, the server typically responds with an HTTP 403 Forbidden status code. This indicates that the server understands the request, but it refuses to fulfill it due to insufficient permissions.

By default, Nginx does not enable directory listing, meaning that if there is no specific index file (e.g., index.html, index.php) present in the directory, Nginx won't automatically generate a directory listing for you to view the contents.

Instead, Nginx relies on the presence of an index file specified in its configuration to determine what content should be served when accessing a directory. If the index file is not found or not configured, Nginx will return a 403 Forbidden error.

This behavior is a security measure to prevent unintentional exposure of directory contents. It ensures that visitors cannot browse the directory structure and access files that should not be publicly accessible.

Traduction:
 if directory listing on: return index.html
 else return 403




Setup routes in a server to different directories.

The CGI should be run in the   directory for relative path file access.????

cgi -> script infinite loop ?? OR error
  --> NO CRASH + ERROR VISIBLE


   Launch multiple servers at the same time with different configurations but with common ports. Does it work? If it does, ask why
the server should work if one of the configurations isn't functional. Keep going
    -> Open to interpretation ??





// CGI w/ fucked script

// Location in conf = directory.
// When accessing URL, check if ends w/ /
      If yes, is directory, handle 
      Else, is file.
      Handle file. Redo path to file w/ root + file
      If suffix, remove ? .html

// COUT some stuff
