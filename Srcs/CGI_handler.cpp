/*
To handle PHP code using php-cgi in a C++ web server, you can follow these steps:

1. 	Identify the location of the php-cgi executable on your system. You will need to provide the full path to this executable.

2.	Receive the incoming HTTP request in your C++ web server and extract the PATH_INFO from the request. 
	PATH_INFO is a common CGI environment variable that contains additional path information provided in the URL after the script name.

3. 	Construct a command to execute the php-cgi executable, passing the necessary arguments. 
	The command should include the full path to php-cgi and the PATH_INFO as a command-line argument. 
	You may also need to include other CGI environment variables like REQUEST_METHOD, QUERY_STRING, CONTENT_TYPE, etc., depending on your server's requirements and the PHP script's expectations.

4. 	Use the appropriate system call or library function in C++ to execute the constructed command and capture its output. 
	For example, you can use the system() function or the popen() function.

5. 	Capture the output of the php-cgi command and send it back as the HTTP response to the client.

Here's an example to illustrate the concept:
*/

#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstdio>

void handleRequest(const char* pathInfo) {
    // Construct the command to execute php-cgi
    char command[256];
    snprintf(command, sizeof(command), "/path/to/php-cgi %s", pathInfo);

    // Open a pipe to capture the output of the command
    FILE* pipe = popen(command, "r");
    if (pipe == nullptr) {
        // Handle the error case
        // ...
        return;
    }

    // Read the output of php-cgi from the pipe
    char buffer[4096];
    std::string output;
    while (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), pipe) != nullptr) {
        output += buffer;
    }

    // Close the pipe
    pclose(pipe);

    // Send the output as the HTTP response
    // ...
}
